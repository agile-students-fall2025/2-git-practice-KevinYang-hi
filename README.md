# On the Importance of "Boring" Software

I stumbled on this gem of an article. It's a few years old but still feels incredibly relevant.

I found this post really interesting because in school and on social media, there's so much hype around using the newest, coolest, most cutting-edge technology. You see job postings asking for 5 years of experience in a framework that's only 3 years old, and it's easy to feel like you're constantly behind.

What I love about this article is that it makes a strong case for the opposite: choosing stable, well-understood, and "boring" technology to get the job done. The author's point is that the goal is to build something useful for people, not to build a resume or experiment with shiny new toys on the company's dime. Using boring tech means less time debugging weird, undocumented edge cases and more time actually building features.

It's a refreshing perspective that takes a lot of the pressure off. It reminds me that being a good engineer isn't about knowing every new library that comes out, but about making smart, practical decisions to solve problems effectively. A really great read!
